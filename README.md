## Hi there, I'm Marco
👶🏻  I'm something like a *burba* in all the tech stack that is currently out there. <br>
💻  I really enjoy exploring new technologies and getting hands-on. <br>
🍷  I'm a wine lover and I love finding new emotions in all of my tastings. <br>

<hr>

I’m currently learning __Flutter__ and __Dart__ to create a mobile application. I start the learning and creation path the last days of June 2022.
